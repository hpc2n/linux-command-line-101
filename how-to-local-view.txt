Set up for local view of edits
===============================

If you do not want to wait for github to check and render the pages, or want to be sure it looks right before doing git push, you can view the pages locally. To do that, do the following (after ´ǵit clone' the repo of course):

1) Create a Python virtual environment OUTSIDE THE REPO DIR !!!

python -m venv /path/to/myvenv

Change myvenv to something suitable

2) Activate

source /path/to/myvenv

3) Install the stuff in requirements file to it

pip install -r /path/to/linux-command-line-101/requirements.txt

4) Serve the pages

mkdocs serve -f /path/to/linux-command-line-101/mkdocs.yml

5) Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/linux-command-line-101/ in a webbrowser

It will update when you change the files (save them)

6) Type 'deactivate' to leave the virtual environment.

7) NOTE: in the future, when you want to look at the files again, only do 2) and 4), 5)
